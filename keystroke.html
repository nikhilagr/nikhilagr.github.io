								<!-- <h2>Problem we are trying to solve</h2> -->
								<p>Keystroke Signature project demonstrates how keystroke dynamics - the unique typing patterns of users can be 
									used as a signature to identify genuine users from imposters. Keystroke signature fuses the simplicity of 
									passwords with increased reliability from biometrics. Unlike other biometrics like IRIS, face, 
									fingerprints etc which need special hardware infrastructure, keystroke biometrics are economical to 
									implement and can be easily integrated into the existing computer security systems. They help augment the 
									existing security infrastructure by being part of a multilevel authentication system. 
									Using Machine learning algorithms, a high accuracy rate in detecting imposters has been demonstrated in this project. 
									The machine learning model is trained with the typing patterns of the subjects. Then it is provided with 
									test data with patterns from the subject as well as from imposters posing as the subject. The model 
									demonstrates the ability to discern genuine users from imposters based on the test patternâ€™s 
									similarity to the trained model for the subject.

								<h2>Methodology</h2>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Data collection and formation of typing pattern</b></li>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Created standalone desktop application using java to capture typing biometrics. Typing pattern consists of hold time, keydown keydown time , keyup keydown time.Hold time is time between press and release of the key, Keyup keydown time is time between pressing of consecutive keys and Keyup-Keydown time is time between release of one key and press of next key. Using these three parameters a pattern is formed which is unique for each user. </li>
                                            
                                            
                                        </ol>
                                    <li><b>Selection of ML Algorithm and training the model</b></li>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>As the problem is classification of user whether the user is genuine or imposter, supervised learning algorithms like logistic regression, support vector machine and K-nearest-neighbour were used.Used sklearn libraries for training the models.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    <li> <b>Test & evaluate the ML Model</b></li>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Train Test Split, where the dataset is divided into two different datasets, training set and testing set.Train the data with training set and test the data on testing set and evaluate the accuracy of the model</li>
                                            <li>Cross Validation: Split dataset into K equal partitions(folds), Use partition 1 as testing set and remaining K-1 partitions as training set and calculate accuracy. Repeat the process K number of times and use average of all the accuracies to evaluate model performance.</li>
                                        </ol>
